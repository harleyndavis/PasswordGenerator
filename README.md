# PasswordGenerator
Android Password Generator
First Android app. Built after going to a Google Developer Group meet up that was an introduction to Android development. 

Purpose: Procedurally generate a seemingly random password from a given passphrase, length and allowed characters. Want to create
passwords that are friendly across any possible site in terms of required character types, length, etc.

TODO: 
      
      -Currently may not include all character types requested. May be good to have an as optional feature but if you want to 
      generate a specific length password that includes all types, may not work(Seems work for most longer passwords, but not             guaranteed.

      -Allow editing of special characters, to be compatible with as many different password varieties as possible.
